RSS ADDICT - README	

	RSS Addict is a simple RSS feed reading webapp that will allow a user to customize their own news feed only reading from sources they add to the list. The app wll also come with a few pre-populated lists of different categories that the user can choose from as well. 

What is an RSS Feed? 

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication and it is used as a way to convey information by converting the information to an XML file which can be easily read by a computer. This RSS reader will retrieve the XML data from every feed address that is provided by the user and stored in a database. When the user logins to their account all their associated feeds will be displayed in an easy to read form and allows the abiltiy to go to the originating website. 

Where can RSS Feeds be found? 

There are a few ways to find RSS Feeds that can be added to the RSS Addict application. The easiest way to find RSS feeds is to look for the RSS symbol on websites that you visit frequently or that you want to follow. If a website does not have a RSS feed symbol available then another way to try and find the RSS feed is using Google Chrome right click on the webpage and select "View page Source". This should show the HTML code of the web page and if you look through the code you may find links that end in .rss. These links can be added to the app and displayed on your personal news feed. The third way to find feeds is by simply using Google to look for avialble feeds in subjects you are interested in. 

How to Use this Web Application:


Upon launching this web application the user will be brought to the login screen. If the user already holds an account then it is just a matter of typing in the username and password and hitting enter. If the user does not yet have an account then they can click the register button where they will be redirected to the registration page. 

To register for an account all fields must be completed in order for the account to be created. Once the account is setup then the user will be automatically logged in and redirected to the home page of the application. 

The Home Page:
	After the user is logged in they will be directed to the homepage. In the homepage will be a aplication menu at the top that will contain a welcome message top center, an add feed input bar on the left hand side, a premade news selection list and a logout button on the right hand side. The remainder of the screen will be empty for now until the user starts to input RSS Feeds. 

To add an RSS Feed simply input the URL/web address of the feed you wish to follow into the Add Feed bar at the top left of the application and hit enter. If there are no errors with the provided address then the main screen will populate with news cards for each individual artivle within the feed. There will also be a selection box on the right hand side so that you can choose to follow all of your feeds at once or read articles from specific feeds only.

If you do not know of any feeds you wish to follow right away then there are premade feed lists that can be chosen instead. There are feeds from 3 different sources within each category to give the users a few feeds that they can follow until they find others they wish to view.  Any feeds that are submitted are saved into a database and recalled and updated the next time the user logs in.
